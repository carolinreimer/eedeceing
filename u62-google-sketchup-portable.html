                            <p> I have a portable hard drive with my older versions of Sketchup installed on them (Google Sketchup 6-8). Do you think it would be possible for me to copy paste the Materials from the old versions into the my installation of Sketchup 2018? I went to work on some models and found that the materials provided were somewhat lacking from older versions, with some of the ones I use more often missing entirely. I have had an early 2015 Macbook 12" that has been a school and light work laptop, but I am starting a new business and need a portable laptop to handle typing, spreadsheet work, presentation drafting, email, and other productivity tasks that require multiple windows. Usually I am able to use a docking station so the 12" screen is less of an issue, but even when I am traveling the postage-stamp screen is wearing me down. Plus DisplayLink is truly unreliable on macOS. And my MacBook 12" is gettin. Hey - Pat from StarterStory.com (https://www.starterstory.com) here with another interview. Today's interview is with Brandon Wong of Photobooth Supply Co. (https://photoboothsupplyco.com), a brand that makes and sells photo booths. Ever been to a wedding or event that has a fun photo booth? Well, these guys design a very fancy version of those photobooths.

I spoke with a friend that night about the iPad and we talked about how the Pro looked like a spec monster, but agin, running iOS it seemed odd.

Hi everyone! With the two month Anniversary of Mind over Meta being close to (if not) today, I figured now is a great time to start to condense information into a single post, until I get some other site or blog to post these on. I'd like to thank everyone for the support I've gotten so far though, it really means alot to me, and I'm glad that I can produce content for this community. ___________ MoM PREVIOUS ARTICLE LINKS Week 1 - Staggered-Hit Game (http://www.reddit.com/r/SSBPM/comm.

I've got a Macbook Pro from 2011 that I can tell is standing on it's last legs. In it's day, it was a quick computer that did what I needed it to do at a fairly quick pace, including running Pro Tools 10. My needs have changed, and I no longer need the laptop for audio recording, but more so for basic game programming (2D)/general coding, and internet browsing of course. I don't really need it for gaming, I just want something that runs basic software quickly. I find a lot of laptops I'm looking to get a new laptop for touring with. It needs to be able to handle some gaming up to and including Skyrim and Just Cause 2 levels of graphics at high settings and some light CAD work. (Opening lighting plots and renders and some simple drafting to show ideas in Google Sketchup.)

Touchscreens are nice for some games, but for others, nothing beats real controls. Though almost all phones/tablets can use a bluetooth gamepad, there are none that are easily portable.
